## Objective
This assignment is intended to test your ability to design and playtest original gameplay mechanics. The focus of this game will be on multiplayer interaction through manipulating a resource economy. Your aim will be to create game dynamics which provide the players with interesting choices and a rich space of strategies. 

## Constraints
Working in groups of 3 or 4, design a physical table-top card game with the following constraints:  
  1. It must use a custom deck of cards of your own design (not a standard deck of playing cards of any variety).
  2. You may also use tokens (e.g. coloured chips or some digital tracking) to represent resources. It must not require any other props.
  3. The number of players must be three or more. (i.e. it cannot be a solo or two-player game).
  4. It must involve at least two different resources with distinct properties

## Goals
Your experience goals are:
  - __Fellowship__: The game should encourage enjoyable inter-player interaction. It may be competitive, co-operative, team-based or any other configuration except pure player-vs-game competition.
  - __Challenge__: The game should involve some elements of skill, including social skill.
  - __Drama__: The game should present the players with interesting choices.

You should refine these goals for your particular game in terms of the details and how they
are achieved but you are to use these as the goals for your player experience.

## Playtesting
You are required to create a detailed playtesting plan for your game and carry out and report on at least some playtesting within your assigned group. 

Your plan needs to show how you would answer the following questions (More detail is given in the deliverables section):
  - Do the players do what I expect them to do? (Behaviour)
  - Do the players feel what I expect them to feel? (Attitude)  

To do this well, you need to approach playtesting with a solid expectation of what kind of behaviour and attitude you desire from your players. Simply playing the game and asking "Is it fun?" is not good enough. Create a meaningful hypothesis and then test to see if it is true.  
For example you might ask:
  - Is the game balanced so that all players have an equal chance of winning?
  - Is the game too easy or too hard?
  - Do the players experience interesting choices at the moments they are intended to?
  - Do the players cooperate or do they tend to act individually?

You should tailor the specific question to the details of your game design. 

Remember that the purpose of playtesting is to discover where your game can be improved. It is very unlikely that your game will be perfect. So if you're only getting positive feedback, you're not looking hard enough. 

With the current circumstances you may need to carry out any actual playtesting within your group, rather than recruiting other playtesters. While this is not ideal, it’s better than having no playtest at all. You will probably need to carry out the playtest using zoom, discord or some other electronic means of communication. 

## Deliverables
There are 2 deliverables. A group report and an individual report.

### Group report
The group report (PDF document) should contain:
  - A written copy of the rules of your game.
  - All the cards required for your game so it can be printed and played.
  - A design document describing:
    1. A discussion of the intended player experience for your game
    2. An explanation of the rules/core gameplay: Why did you choose them? How do they achieve your experience goals?
    3. A list of the interesting decisions in your game, with an explanation of why they are balanced, informed, consequential and situational.
    4. An explanation of your resource economy, describing the inputs, outputs, cost and value of each resource type and how they are balanced.
  - A playtesting plan/report stating
      - which aspects of the game design would be tested. You should cover at least all major aspects of the design. The plan should show a series of prototypes created using an iterative design process, playtested at each stage 
      - hypotheses to test each aspect/prototype, the design of the playtest and specification of the data that would be gathered.
      - a report of at least one completed playtest carried out by your group, relating to one stage of the playtesting plan.
      - for the playtest that was carried out, a description of what changes were made to the design subsequent to the playtest and how those changes derived from the gathered data

### Individual report
The individual report (PDF document) should consist of two parts, a reflective postmortem and a statement of contribution.

The reflective postmortem (__1000 words__) should describe and analyse:
  - Aspects of your group’s __*game design*__ that succeeded, achieving your intended design goals.
  - Aspects of your group’s __*game design*__ which worked poorly and design goals which you feel you failed to achieve.
  - Aspects of your group's game design and development __*process*__ which succeeded and helped you create your game.
  - Aspects of your group's design and development __*process*__ which caused problems or which could be improved

The statement of contribution should be no more than __half a page__ and briefly detail your personal contribution to the project. i.e., what aspects you contributed to (such as rules, card design, playtesting, etc) and how much you contributed. We will be cross-checking the statements of group members.

## Submission
Submit your group reports and individual reports using the iLearn links on the unit home page.

## Marking
Your final mark will be consist of:
  - 25% based on your reflective postmortem
  - 25% based on the quality of your contributions
  - 30% on your group's design document
  - 20% on your group's playtesting report

Your reflective postmortem will be marked on:
  1. Your ability to critique your work and learn from it.
  2. Your ability to critique your process and learn from it.

We will be looking for evidence that you can honestly evaluate your own work, including any mistakes you made, and learn how to do better in future.

Your design document will be marked on:
  1. how well your game achieves the stated goals
  2. how well your report describes your design

You are not expected to make a perfect game in such a limited time-span, but you are
expected to design thoughtfully and be aware of how your game works or fails.

We will be looking for evidence that the game was designed and not just made by accident. This is shown by a reasoned explanation of Mechanics / Dynamics / Experience of game and how they interrelate. The focus should be bottom up: here are the mechanics, how do they make you feel.

Your playtesting document will be marked on:
  1. A clear and thorough plan, stating what aspects would be tested
  2. Clear hypotheses that you were planning to test (not just 'is it fun'?)
  3. Example elements from the prototype (or prototypes) designed to test these hypotheses
  4. A description of the data (attitudinal and behavioural) that would be gathered at each stage of the playtesting
  5. Data gathered from at least one actual playtest
  6. Analysis of the data gathered and conclusions and changes to the design made based on the playtest

## Rubric

### For the group report
__High Distinction:__ In addition to the requirements for distinction the game design is creative and innovates in some interesting and substantial way. The reflection demonstrates particularly deep and critical understanding.  
__Distinction:__ In addition to the requirements for credit the design is very-well thought out and is genuinely fun to play. The design document sets out the rules concisely and without any ambiguity. The explanations of (goals, rules, dynamics, etc) demonstrate distinctive insight and application of game design principles. The reflection carefully analyses the effects of the flaws identified.  
__Credit:__ The document has a clear and complete articulation of the rules. It sets out a clear set of design goals for the experience which expand on and more precisely specify the broad goals in the assignment spec. It contains an explanation of rules justified in terms of the game dynamics they create (with a particular focus on the resource economy). There is a clear explanation of how the game rules achieve the desired experience. The game itself demonstrates a good understanding of design principles and the ability to use them thoughtfully in creating a game. The reflection identifies flaws and proposes reasonable solutions.  
__Pass:__ The game is complete and playable, even if some effort is needed to understand the rules. The design document contains all required sections but is lacking or superficial in significant ways.  
__Fail:__ The rules and/or design components are so incomplete the game cannot be played. The design document is missing or incomplete.

### For the playtesting report
__High Distinction__: In addition the requirements for distinction, the playtesting plan demonstrates a cycle for improvement of the game through playtesting and design. The tests were extremely well chosen and designed. The analysis demonstrates a sustained high-level of insight.  
__Distinction__: In addition to the requirements for credit, there is identification of very specific details to test in order to tune particular parts of the design. All major aspects of the game are covered in the plan and the focus of the playtesting is particularly well-chosen. Data gathering goes beyond mere general observation and surveying (e.g. recording specific data about player actions, getting players to think aloud, etc). A/B tests were used in the planning. The analysis of the results shows a high level of insight and changes to the game are shown to directly relate to the data gathered  
__Credit__: There is a clearly stated plan for the playtesting, covering most of the major aspects of the game. The hypotheses stated and data to be gathered were reasonable, with at most one or two flaws. Data included both attitudinal and behavioural aspects. The tests carried out were appropriate to answer the question of whether the experience expectations were correct or not. A playtest was carried out and there is sensible analysis of the results, including identification of at least one way in which the game was improved subsequent to the playtest. At least some justification is given for how those changes derived from the data gathered.  
__Pass:__ A playtesting plan was given but it omitted significant aspects of the game design. Hypotheses were set for the aspects given, and data proposed. A playtest was carried out and data gathered. Some analysis of the data gathered was attempted. Changes to the game subsequent to the playtest are stated. However, the questions may have been poorly formed, the test not well related to the questions, the analysis is superficial or otherwise lacking and/or the analysis does not clearly lead to the changes made.  
__Fail:__ The requirements for Pass are not met.

### For the individual reflective postmortem
__High Distinction:__ In addition to the requirements for distinction the report demonstrates sustained, insightful reflection.  
__Distinction:__ In addition to the requirements for credit, there is a thorough and insightful analysis of the game and your group's design process. There is also personal ownership of problems and insight into solutions.  
__Credit:__ The reflective report is an honest critique of both your game design and your development process, recognising both your successes and your failures.  
__Pass:__ The reflective report is a critique of the game, your group's design process, including success or failures, but is superficial in one or two areas.  
__Fail:__ The report is superficial and/or lacking. There is little evidence of understanding of the issues involved.

### For the quality of contribution
The mark will be based on the areas of your particular contribution, assessed as above.
